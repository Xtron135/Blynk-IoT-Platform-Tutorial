# Blynk-IoT-Platform-Tutorial
This repo contain a templete of arduino program to be use with Blynk IoT platform.

Blynk is one of the most popular IoT Platform for makers.
But couple years ago Blynk decide to launch a new platform called Blynk IoT.
Make sure you know the difference between old and new blink.

* OLD = Blynk Legacy. Green and black theme. Will not accept any new user. Existing user can still use it.
* NEW = Blynk IoT. Green and white theme.

In the new Blynk IoT documentaion, there are a lot of confusion in the programs. They didnt update their documentation.
Some of the program use the old code from Blynk Legacy. And some of them use a new code from Blynk IoT.
From the documentaion, you can even find 2 copy of program with the same title for example, but with different code entirely.

In this repo I provide a template, and of course tested and still working as November 2022. This program template should be 
the most basic 'skeleton' for you to write any Blynk IoT program. 

Also included here is a pdf tutorial for reference about Blynk IoT basics.

!!IMPORTANT!!

At the time of writing, Blynk IoT platform only works with ESP32 boards. So dont cry when you already bought ESP8266 because
it is cheaper but then its not working with Blynk IoT. Just buy ESP32. XD
